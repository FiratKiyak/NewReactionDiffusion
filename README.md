# NewReactionDiffusion

These are the results of my research on reaction-diffusion models and the concept of evolution
of evolvability for the graduate course CMPE59E-Evolutionary Dynamics I have taken in 2021 at
Boðaziçi University as a master's student. I have extended the reaction-diffusion model 
of Alan Turing, and found that more complicated behaviour can be obtained with this
extension. The visuals are more biological looking, and phenomenon like 
regeneration and phase transitions can be observed. 

Please see the videos. Project report is also present, but it does not talk about how this
visuals are obtained. It is a survey for previous related research.
